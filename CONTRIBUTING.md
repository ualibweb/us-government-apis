- The site housing the API must appear active and have official documentation published by the US government.
- Be freely accessible for all users.

## Formatting Guidelines

- APIs are sorted alphabetically first by department, then agency, then by API title.
- Please leave out 'API' from the title of an API, even if it is part of the official name.
- If no official title for an API exists, give it the name of its governing agency. If an agency manages multiple unnamed APIs, create a brief title based on the data available through the API.
