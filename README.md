# U.S. Government APIs

A list of public APIs maintained by the U.S. Government, organized by department.

## Overview

This list is designed to be an up-to-date repository containing APIs published by the U.S. government. Note that a similar, but now deprecated service, was maintained by the General Services Administration's [18F](https://github.com/18F/API-All-the-X). This list in part draws from [18F's list of government APIs](https://github.com/18F/API-All-the-X/blob/master/_data/individual_apis.yml).

For guides on how to use pulbic APIs, please see the [Scholarly API Cookbook](https://ualibweb.github.io/UALIB_ScholarlyAPI_Cookbook/content/about/introduction.html).

_This list is a work in progress, please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) to add any missing APIs._
